        "download_delta_mbps": 98.4,

      "trend_summary": "Since last scan: download improved, upload improved, ping improved, networks worsened."

    "diagnosis": "Your network has a moderate health score with several neighboring networks leading to potential interference. Random dropouts may be due to such congestion and poor channel selection.",

      "ping_ms": 40.72,
      "interpretation": "Current speeds are generally good, especially download, but are affected by network congestion. The latency is acceptable for most online activities."
    },
    "problems": [
      "High network congestion with 16 total networks detected.",
      "Random dropouts may be caused by interference from nearby networks.",
      "2.4GHz channel is overcrowded, increasing the likelihood of dropouts."
    ],
    "fixes": [
      "Change the 2.4GHz channel to 1 for less congestion.",
      "Switch the 5GHz channel to 149, as it has more available bandwidth and lower interference.",
      "Reposition the router away from the bedroom window to mitigate outside interference.",
      "Consider enabling Band Steering if your router supports it for balancing devices between 2.4GHz and 5GHz efficiently.",
      "Check router placement to ensure optimal coverage throughout your 1500 sqft space."
