      "explanation": "Your Wi-Fi feels strong, with solid speeds suitable for most activities, but occasional dropouts can disrupt your experience, especially during video calls or gaming. The signal quality is good, but the network faces interference from several nearby networks. Additionally, the upload speed is slightly lower, which can affect activities like uploading large files or video conferencing.",

        "ping_delta_ms": -6.68,
        "networks_delta": -5
      },
      "trend_summary": "Since the last scan, download speed worsened significantly, upload remained about the same, and ping improved slightly."

      "download_mbps": 83.1,
      "upload_mbps": 22.74,
      "ping_ms": 39.09,
      "interpretation": "With a download speed of 83.1 Mbps, your Wi-Fi can comfortably support 4K streaming on a couple of devices simultaneously. However, competitive gaming may experience slight delays due to the upload speed and latency, especially if multiple devices are connected during usage."
    },
    "problems": [
      "High congestion on the 2.4GHz band causing random dropouts.",
      "Interference from multiple nearby Wi-Fi networks reducing performance.",
      "Limited upload speed affecting cloud backups and video calls.",
      "5GHz signal may not reach all areas effectively due to placement."
    ],
    "fixes": [
      "Change the 2.4GHz channel to 1, which has the least congestion.",
      "Switch the 5GHz channel to 149 for reduced interference.",
      "Enable bandwidth management (QoS) to prioritize gaming and video calls.",
      "Consider relocating the router to a more central location in the home to optimize coverage.",
      "Upgrade to a dual-band or tri-band router for better traffic handling as more devices are added."

    "router_steps": [
      "Log in to your router at http://10.0.0.1.",
      "Navigate to Connection > Wi-Fi > Edit > 2.4GHz Channel and set it to Channel 1.",
      "Next, go to Connection > Wi-Fi > Edit > 5GHz Channel and set it to Channel 149.",
      "Enable QoS in your router settings under Advanced > QoS and prioritize device traffic.",
      "Consider moving the router to a more central location for better Wi-Fi coverage."
