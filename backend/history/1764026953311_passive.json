      "High network congestion on both 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands.",

    "fixes": [
      "Switch the 2.4GHz channel to 1 to reduce congestion from other networks using channel 11.",
      "Change the 5GHz channel to 149 to minimize interference from overlapping networks on channel 36.",
      "Consider relocating the router closer to the center of your home for improved coverage.",
      "Enable Smart Connect if available to allow the router to automatically manage devices between bands efficiently.",
      "Monitor connected devices and disconnect any that are not actively in use to allocate bandwidth better."
