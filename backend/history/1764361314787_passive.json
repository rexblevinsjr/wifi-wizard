      "explanation": "Your Wi-Fi experience is generally strong but has some minor issues. You may encounter occasional dropouts and instability, particularly during bandwidth-intensive activities such as gaming or streaming. This is likely due to moderate signal interference and the overall congestion of networks in your area, especially on the 2.4GHz band. The connectivity is decent, but the presence of multiple neighboring networks suggests that improvements could be made.",

        "download_delta_mbps": 98.5,

      "trend_summary": "Since the last scan, download speeds improved significantly, upload speeds increased slightly, and ping responsiveness worsened."

      "download_mbps": 98.5,
      "upload_mbps": 22.63,
      "ping_ms": 44.78,
      "interpretation": "Your current download speed is excellent for multiple devices, allowing for smooth 4K streaming and competitive gaming. However, the 22.63 Mbps upload speed may limit activities like video conferencing or large file uploads if multiple devices are active simultaneously. The ping time indicates there's a noticeable latency that can affect real-time applications."

    "problems": [
      "Multiple nearby networks leading to potential interference and random dropouts.",
      "Moderate 2.4GHz congestion causing slowdowns and instability during high usage.",
      "High latency (ping) affecting time-sensitive gaming and video calls."
    ],
    "fixes": [
      "Switch the 2.4GHz channel to channel 1 for better signal strength and reduced interference.",
      "Change the 5GHz channel to 149, which is less congested compared to other options in your area.",
      "Enable QoS (Quality of Service) on your router to prioritize gaming traffic and improve stability.",
      "Consider moving the router closer to the center of your home to improve coverage.",
      "If problems persist, consider upgrading to a dual-band router that can better handle multiple devices and bands."

    "router_steps": [
      "Log in to your router admin page at http://10.0.0.1.",
      "Navigate to the 'Connection' > 'Wi-Fi' settings.",
      "Change the 2.4GHz channel to '1' and the 5GHz channel to '149'.",
      "Enable QoS by going to 'Connection' > 'QoS' and setting your gaming device as a high-priority device.",
      "Consider relocating the router to a more central location in your home.",
      "Save the changes and restart your router."

      "Is your router placed in an open area or near walls that may cause signal loss?"
