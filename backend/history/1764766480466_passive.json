      "explanation": "Your Wi-Fi performance feels moderate overall, which may lead to noticeable issues during activities like video calls, gaming, or streaming. The issues are likely arising from a combination of signal interference from multiple nearby networks and congestion on the 2.4GHz band. While your download speeds are acceptable for general usage, there might be inconsistent performance, especially when multiple devices are active.",

      "upload_mbps": 23.15,
      "ping_ms": 24.64,
      "interpretation": "With a download speed of 101.59 Mbps, the connection is suitable for HD streaming on multiple devices and general browsing. However, upload speeds at 23.15 Mbps might cause interruptions in activities like video conferencing or uploading large files. The ping of 24.64 ms is relatively low, but high traffic can cause spikes, potentially affecting gaming experiences."

    "problems": [
      "High congestion on 2.4GHz band causing random dropouts and slow performance during peak usage.",
      "Multiple networks operating on overlapping channels leading to signal interference.",
      "Moderate distance from the router may reduce signal strength in certain areas."
    ],
    "fixes": [
      "Switch the 2.4GHz channel to channel 1 to minimize overlap with neighboring networks.",
      "Change the 5GHz channel to 149 as it currently has the least congestion.",
      "Consider enabling Band Steering to optimize device distribution between 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands.",
      "Reposition the router closer to the center of your home, away from walls, to improve coverage.",
      "As an easy win, reboot the router to clear temporary issues causing dropouts.",
      "Evaluate upgrading to a dual-band mesh system to better handle congestion and improve coverage."
    ],
    "router_steps": [
      "Log in to your router admin page at http://10.0.0.1.",
      "Go to Connection > Wi-Fi > Edit.",
      "Change the 2.4GHz channel to 1 and save the settings.",
      "Next, change the 5GHz channel to 149 and save the settings.",
      "Enable Band Steering from the advanced settings to let devices choose the best band automatically.",
      "Reboot your router for the changes to take effect."
