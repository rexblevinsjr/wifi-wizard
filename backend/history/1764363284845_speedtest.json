      "explanation": "The Wi-Fi performance is moderate, showing noticeable issues that could result in frustrating experiences, especially during video calls or gaming. High congestion in both 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands can lead to connectivity dropouts and instability. The current signal quality is acceptable but suffers from interference and latency issues, impacting general usability. Users may experience buffering during streaming and unpredictable performance during online gaming.",

      "upload_mbps": 22.55,
      "ping_ms": 45.77,
      "interpretation": "The download speed of 94.58 Mbps is quite suitable for most activities, allowing for multiple devices engaged in streaming 1080p content simultaneously. The upload speed is adequate for general tasks, but it may pose a challenge for heavy users, particularly if they plan to upload large files or use video conferencing tools. The latency of 45.77 ms is acceptable but could lead to slight delays in competitive online gaming."

    "problems": [
      "High congestion on both 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands causing random dropouts and instability.",
      "Numerous networks detected (15), contributing to interference and lower performance.",
      "Poor signal quality on some channels, which may lead to unreliable connections.",
      "Ping times have noticeably increased, impacting real-time applications."
    ],
    "fixes": [
      "Switch the 2.4GHz channel to 1 to reduce interference, as channel 11 is heavily congested.",
      "Change the 5GHz channel to 149 for less congestion and improved performance.",
      "Consider relocating the router from the bedroom window to a central location in the house for better coverage.",
      "Enable Smart Connect to allow the router to optimize band usage effectively.",
      "For serious users, consider upgrading to a tri-band router that can handle increased load and traffic."
