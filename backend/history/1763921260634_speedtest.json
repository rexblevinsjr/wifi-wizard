      "explanation": "The Wi-Fi network performance is generally good, with decent speeds and reasonable latency. However, there are some congestion issues due to the number of neighboring networks.",

      },
      "trend_summary": "Since last scan: download improved, upload improved, ping worsened, networks increased."

      "interpretation": "The download speed is excellent, suitable for most applications. The upload speed is adequate for casual use, but the ping shows some potential for improvement."
    },
    "problems": [
      "Random dropouts due to congestion from 9 neighboring networks.",
      "Potential interference from overlapping channels, particularly on 2.4GHz.",
      "Insufficient signal strength in certain areas because of router placement.",
      "Possible QoS misconfigurations leading to reduced performance during peak usage."
    ],
    "fixes": [
      "Change the 2.4GHz channel to channel 1 to minimize interference (current channel 11 is congested).",
      "Set the 5GHz channel to 149 for better performance given the congestion on channels 36 and 48.",
      "Consider repositioning the router away from windows or potential obstructions to improve coverage.",
      "Enable Smart Connect if supported to allow devices to automatically choose the best band.",
      "Monitor and adjust Quality of Service settings to prioritize gaming traffic during peak usage."
