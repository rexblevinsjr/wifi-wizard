      "High congestion on the 2.4GHz band causing potential instability.",
      "Low RSSI on nearby networks impacting performance.",

    "fixes": [
      "Change the 2.4GHz channel to 6 to reduce congestion (current best option).",
      "Select 5GHz channel 149 for optimal performance, as channels 36 and 157 are too crowded.",
      "Consider relocating the router to a more central location in the home to improve coverage.",
      "Disable unnecessary background applications on connected devices to enhance speed.",
