      "Change the 2.4GHz channel to 1 to reduce interference; currently on 6 and 11 (very congested).",
      "Change the 5GHz channel to 149 for less congestion; currently using 36 which has multiple networks competing.",
      "Consider repositioning the router closer to the center of the house for better coverage.",
