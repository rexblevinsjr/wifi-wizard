      "1. High congestion in the 2.4GHz band causing interference and dropouts.",
      "2. Suboptimal channel usage in both bands.",

    "fixes": [
      "Change the 2.4GHz channel to 6 (least congested option).",
      "Change the 5GHz channel to 149 (for better performance based on congestion analysis).",
      "Consider relocating the router away from the window for improved signal distribution throughout your home.",
      "Ensure that Smart Connect (if available) is enabled to allow automatic band steering.",
      "Limit the number of devices actively using high bandwidth at the same time."
