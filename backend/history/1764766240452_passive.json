      "explanation": "Your Wi-Fi performance is strong but experiencing minor issues, which may affect activities like streaming and video calls. The setup exhibits some interference, especially on the 5GHz band due to congestion from neighboring networks. While speed is acceptable for most home usage, the occasional dropouts could disrupt more sensitive applications such as gaming or Zoom calls.",

      "trend_summary": "Since the last scan, download speed improved slightly, upload stayed about the same, and ping worsened."

      "ping_ms": 40.0,
      "interpretation": "With a download speed of nearly 93 Mbps, the connection is capable of supporting HD streaming and web browsing for multiple devices. However, the upload speed of 22.48 Mbps might be insufficient for heavy video conferencing, especially if multiple users are online simultaneously. The latency could impact real-time gaming, but general browsing and streaming should remain stable."

    "problems": [
      "High 5GHz congestion causing random dropouts and buffering.",
      "Suboptimal channel selection leading to interference from nearby networks.",
      "Limited upload speed for video conferencing or uploading large files."
    ],
    "fixes": [
      "Change the 2.4GHz channel to 1 for better congestion management.",
      "Switch the 5GHz channel to 149 to avoid overlap with other networks.",
      "Enable Smart Connect on your router to automatically optimize device connections.",
      "Consider relocating the router away from windows for improved signal coverage.",
      "Perform a check and possibly upgrade to a dual-band or tri-band router if issues persist."

    "router_steps": [
      "Log in to your router's admin page at http://10.0.0.1.",
      "Navigate to the 'Connection' tab and select 'Wi-Fi'.",
      "Edit the 2.4GHz settings to change the channel to 1.",
      "Edit the 5GHz settings to change the channel to 149.",
      "Enable Smart Connect to allow the router to manage connections automatically.",
      "If connectivity issues persist, consider relocating the router to a central open area in your home."
