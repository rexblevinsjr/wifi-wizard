      },
      "trend_summary": "Since last scan: download improved, upload improved, ping worsened, networks increased."

    "fixes": [
      "Switch your 2.4GHz channel to 1 for less congestion.",
      "For the 5GHz band, change to channel 149 to optimize performance.",
      "Consider repositioning your router closer to the center of your home to improve coverage.",
