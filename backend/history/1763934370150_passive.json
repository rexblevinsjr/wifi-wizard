      "explanation": "The Wi-Fi network is performing reasonably well but is experiencing some congestion and random dropouts.",

        "download_delta_mbps": 21.54,

      },
      "trend_summary": "Since last scan: download improved, upload worsened, ping improved, networks increased."

    "diagnosis": "Your Wi-Fi network is facing congestion from multiple nearby networks, which may be contributing to the random dropouts. Adjusting your channel settings can help mitigate this issue.",

      "download_mbps": 104.7,
      "upload_mbps": 22.19,
      "ping_ms": 24.28,
      "interpretation": "The download speed is excellent, while the upload speed is slightly below expectations for your ISP plan. The ping time is good, indicating low latency."

    "fixes": [
      "Change the 2.4GHz channel to 1, which is less congested and has a better RSSI (-75 dBm) than channel 6.",
      "Switch the 5GHz channel to 149, which is less congested than other 5GHz options in use.",
      "Consider positioning the router closer to the center of the house for better coverage.",
      "Enable Smart Connect (if your router supports it) to automatically balance device connections between 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands.",
      "Reduce interference by keeping electronic devices away from the router.",
      "Regularly reboot the router to refresh your connection and settings."
