      "interpretation": "While your download speed is nearly matching your ISP plan, the upload speed is slightly below average. The ping time is decent but could be optimized for better gaming performance."

    "fixes": [
      "Change the 2.4GHz channel to either 1 or 11 to minimize congestion.",
      "Set the 5GHz channel to 149 for optimal performance and reduced interference.",
      "Consider relocating the router closer to the center of the home or higher up to improve coverage.",
      "Enable QoS to prioritize bandwidth for gaming and ensure smoother performance.",
