      "wifi_health_score": 72,
      "explanation": "Your Wi-Fi health is decent, but congestion from nearby networks may lead to intermittent issues.",
      "trend": {
        "download_delta_mbps": 104.3,
        "upload_delta_mbps": 22.9,

      },
      "trend_summary": "Since last scan: download improved, upload improved, ping improved, networks worsened."
    },
    "diagnosis": "Your home Wi-Fi is experiencing random dropouts potentially due to congestion on the 2.4GHz band. The router location may also be contributing to the issue.",
    "performance": {
      "download_mbps": 104.3,
      "upload_mbps": 22.9,
      "ping_ms": 25.63,
      "interpretation": "Your download speed is excellent for your plan, but the upload speed is slightly below average. Latency is good, but congestion can still affect overall performance."
    },
    "problems": [
      "High congestion on the 2.4GHz band due to 10 competing networks.",
      "Weak signal strength from neighboring SSIDs.",
      "Inconsistent connection leading to random dropouts.",
      "Suboptimal router placement near window interfering with signal.",
      "Limited upload bandwidth causing issues with gaming."
    ],
    "fixes": [
      "Change your 2.4GHz channel to either 1 or 6 to reduce congestion, as channel 11 is crowded.",
      "Switch to 5GHz channel 149 or 157 to take advantage of less interference.",
      "Consider repositioning your router away from the window to a more central location for improved coverage.",
      "Enable QoS (Quality of Service) on your gateway to prioritize gaming traffic.",
      "Regularly restart your router to clear any temporary performance issues."
