      "explanation": "Your Wi-Fi performance is currently moderate, which may lead to noticeable issues like random dropouts, particularly during high-demand usage such as streaming or gaming. The main cause appears to be congestion on the 2.4GHz band and interference from nearby networks, contributing to unstable connections. While speeds are adequate for general use, the connection may falter during peak times or with multiple devices.",

      "interpretation": "The internet speed is decent, suitable for activities such as HD streaming and video conferencing on a couple of devices. However, during peak usage, you may experience lag, especially during competitive gaming. With multiple devices connected, performance may degrade, leading to inconsistent experiences."

    "fixes": [
      "Switch your 2.4GHz channel to channel 1 to reduce congestion.",
      "Change your 5GHz channel to 149 for better performance based on least interference.",
      "Position your router in a more central location to improve signal coverage.",
      "Consider enabling Band Steering to optimize device connectivity to the best available band.",
      "For a deeper fix, invest in a mesh Wi-Fi system to eliminate dead zones and enhance overall coverage.",
      "As an easy win, you can adjust channel settings directly via your router admin page."
