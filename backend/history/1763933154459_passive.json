      "wifi_health_score": 82,
      "explanation": "The Wi-Fi environment shows relatively good health but is affected by moderate congestion and some signal noise.",

      "trend_summary": "Since last scan: Download worsened, upload stayed the same, ping worsened, networks decreased."

    "diagnosis": "Your Wi-Fi is stable but faces occasional dropouts, likely due to congestion and interference from nearby networks.",

      "ping_ms": 27.15,
      "interpretation": "Download speeds are close to your ISP plan, while upload speeds are slightly below expectations. Ping is good but could be improved."

    "problems": [
      "1. Moderate network congestion with a total of 10 surrounding networks.",
      "2. Random dropouts that may disrupt usage, particularly in high-demand scenarios.",
      "3. Potential interference from overlapping 2.4GHz channels."
    ],
    "fixes": [
      "Change your 2.4GHz channel to 6 for less congestion.",
      "Change your 5GHz channel to 149 for better performance, as channels 36 and 44 are congested.",
      "Consider relocating the router for better coverage and reduced interference from walls and furniture.",
      "Enable Band Steering if supported to optimize device connections across bands.",
      "Increase the distance from potential interference sources such as microwaves or cordless phones."
