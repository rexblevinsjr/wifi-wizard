      "trend_summary": "Since last scan: download improved, upload improved, ping improved, networks increased."

    "diagnosis": "The random dropouts you are experiencing may be caused by network congestion and interference from neighboring SSIDs. The current channel settings need optimization for better performance.",

      "upload_mbps": 22.55,
      "ping_ms": 29.35,
      "interpretation": "Download speeds are strong and above the ISP plan, while upload speeds are adequate, leading to a decent overall performance with low latency."

    "problems": [
      "High congestion on the 2.4GHz band with multiple overlapping networks.",
      "Random dropouts likely due to poor channel selection.",
      "Interference from neighboring SSIDs on common channels."
    ],
    "fixes": [
      "Switch the 2.4GHz channel to either 1 or 6, depending on the least congestion and strongest RSSI.",
      "Change the 5GHz channel to 149 as it is less crowded compared to 36.",
      "Consider enabling Band Steering if available, to automatically guide devices to the least congested band."
