      "interpretation": "The download speed is close to the ISP plan, but upload speed is underperforming. Ping time is acceptable but slightly worsened."

    "problems": [
      "High congestion on 2.4GHz band with multiple networks on channel 11.",
      "Interference from neighboring Wi-Fi signals, especially on 5GHz.",
      "Inadequate upload speed compared to expectations based on the ISP plan."
    ],
    "fixes": [
      "Switch your 2.4GHz channel to 1, which is less congested than channel 11.",
      "Change your 5GHz channel to 149, which has fewer competing networks.",
      "Consider relocating the router to a more central location to improve coverage area.",
      "Enable Smart Connect or Band Steering, if available, to balance device connections.",
      "Reduce the number of devices actively using the upload bandwidth during peak times to improve performance."
