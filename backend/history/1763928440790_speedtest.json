      "Set 2.4GHz channel to 6, which has lower congestion compared to channels 1 and 11.",
      "Set 5GHz channel to 149, which has the least congestion and is within the preferable range.",
      "Consider relocating the router to a more central location in the home to improve coverage.",
      "Enable band steering if supported to optimize device connections between 2.4GHz and 5GHz.",
      "If available, update the router firmware to improve stability and performance.",
