      "Change the 2.4GHz channel to channel 1 for less congestion, as channels 11 and 1 are already overcrowded.",
      "Change the 5GHz channel to channel 149 for optimal performance, avoiding congested channels 36 and 44.",
      "Consider relocating the router away from the bedroom window to a more central location in the home to improve coverage.",
