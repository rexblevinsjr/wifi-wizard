      "wifi_health_score": 82,
      "explanation": "Your Wi-Fi is performing well but has some minor issues that could lead to occasional dropouts. The signal quality is decent, although there\u2019s a fair amount of congestion due to multiple competing networks. This may impact the experience during peak use times, especially when engaging in activities like gaming or video calling.",

      "upload_mbps": 22.94,
      "ping_ms": 40.05,
      "interpretation": "The current download speed is more than sufficient for streaming and browsing on several devices. However, with competitive gaming, the increased ping may lead to latency issues. Overall, this setup should comfortably support work and leisure activities, but monitoring will be crucial during high demand."

    "problems": [
      "High 2.4GHz congestion causing random dropouts and buffering during use.",
      "Moderate 5GHz congestion which can lead to intermittent connectivity issues, especially when multiple devices are online.",
      "Potential issues with router placement affecting signal distribution throughout the house."
    ],
    "fixes": [
      "Switch the 2.4GHz channel to channel 1 for better performance since it has lower congestion compared to channel 11.",
      "Change the 5GHz channel to 149 to minimize interference from other networks on channel 36 and 157.",
      "Consider placing the router in a more centralized location in the house for improved signal coverage.",
      "Enable Smart Connect to allow the router to optimize the connection dynamically across devices.",
      "If issues persist, consider upgrading to a dual-band router with better capabilities."
