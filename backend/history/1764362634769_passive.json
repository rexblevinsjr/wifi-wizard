      "wifi_health_score": 82,
      "explanation": "Your Wi-Fi feels strong but may occasionally cause issues like random dropouts during video calls or gaming. The signal quality is decent, but there's notable interference from multiple nearby networks, particularly on the 2.4GHz band. This can lead to frustrating experiences during peak usage times, especially when multiple devices are connected.",

      "interpretation": "At 89.24 Mbps download speed, your setup comfortably supports HD streaming and video calls on several devices simultaneously. However, competitive gaming might face occasional latency spikes. The upload speed is sufficient for cloud backups, but may feel sluggish during heavy usage."
    },
    "problems": [
      "High 2.4GHz congestion leading to random dropouts and buffering.",
      "Significant interference from neighboring networks on both bands, especially 2.4GHz.",
      "Inadequate router placement causing weak signals in certain areas.",
      "Latency spikes recorded may impact real-time applications like gaming and video chat."
    ],
    "fixes": [
      "Change the 2.4GHz channel to channel 1 for less congestion.",
      "Switch the 5GHz channel to channel 149 to avoid interference.",
      "Enable Smart Connect or Band Steering to optimize device connections.",
      "Consider moving your router location from the bedroom window to a more central position in your home.",
      "Upgrade your ISP plan for higher speed if possible, especially for multiple device usage.",
      "Use a Wi-Fi extender to strengthen signals in weaker areas of your home."

    "router_steps": [
      "Log in to your router settings at http://10.0.0.1.",
      "Navigate to Connection > Wi-Fi.",
      "Change the 2.4GHz Channel to '1' and save settings.",
      "Go to the 5GHz settings and change the channel to '149'.",
