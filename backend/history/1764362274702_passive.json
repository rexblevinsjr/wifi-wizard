      "explanation": "Your Wi-Fi connection is generally strong but showing some minor issues. The performance is good for typical browsing and streaming, but you may notice intermittent dropouts during gaming or video calls. Signal quality is decent; however, the presence of several nearby networks may cause congestion. Balancing between the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands can further improve your overall connectivity.",

    "fixes": [
      "Change the 2.4GHz channel to 6 to reduce congestion.",
      "Optimize 5GHz channel to 149 for better performance.",
      "Enable Band Steering to automatically assign devices to the best frequency.",
      "Consider relocating the router away from the bedroom window to minimize obstructions.",
