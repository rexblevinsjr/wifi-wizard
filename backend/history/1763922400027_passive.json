      "explanation": "Your Wi-Fi network is performing well but can still experience some interference and congestion, leading to occasional dropouts.",

        "download_delta_mbps": 103.67,

      },
      "trend_summary": "Since last scan: download improved, upload stayed the same, ping worsened, networks increased."

    "diagnosis": "You are facing random dropouts likely due to interference from other networks and a congested 2.4GHz band.",

      "ping_ms": 31.32,
      "interpretation": "Your download speed is strong, but the upload speed is slightly lower than expected for your plan. The ping is reasonable for most online activities."

    "problems": [
      "High interference on the 2.4GHz band from multiple networks leading to random dropouts.",
      "Congested 5GHz band with three overlapping networks in use.",
      "Low RSSI values on several devices indicating weak signals."
    ],
    "fixes": [
      "Switch 2.4GHz channel to 1 or 6 to reduce interference (current channel 11 is crowded).",
      "Change the 5GHz channel to 149 or 161, which are currently underutilized.",
      "Consider relocating the router to a more central area of your home for improved coverage.",
      "Enable Smart Connect to allow your devices to automatically shift between bands for optimal performance.",
      "Check for physical obstructions between your devices and the router, and minimize them if possible."
