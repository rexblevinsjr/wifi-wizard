      "trend_summary": "Since last scan: download improved, upload stayed the same, ping worsened, networks increased."

    "problems": [
      "Moderate congestion on both 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands.",
      "Random dropouts could indicate interference or network overload.",
      "Possible device management issues due to the number of connected devices."
    ],
    "fixes": [
      "Switch your 2.4GHz channel to channel 1 to reduce congestion, as it's the least crowded.",
      "Set your 5GHz channel to 149 for optimal performance, given current congestion on lower channels.",
      "Consider repositioning the router to a more central location for better coverage.",
      "Enable band steering to allow devices to optimally choose between 2.4GHz and 5GHz.",
      "Minimize interference by ensuring your router is placed away from walls and electronic devices."
