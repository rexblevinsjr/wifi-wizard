      "explanation": "The Wi-Fi network is moderately congested, leading to potential dropouts and degraded performance.",

      "trend_summary": "Since last scan: download improved, upload improved, ping worsened, networks increased."

    "diagnosis": "The network is experiencing moderate congestion, which contributes to random dropouts. The device placement and channel selection could be further optimized to improve stability.",

      "Moderate congestion from multiple overlapping networks.",

    "fixes": [
      "Change the 2.4GHz channel to 1 to reduce overlap with other networks.",
      "Change the 5GHz channel to 149, which is less congested compared to 36 and 44.",
      "Consider relocating the router to a more central location in the home to minimize signal obstruction.",
      "Enable Smart Connect if supported, to automatically manage connections based on the device type and network conditions.",
