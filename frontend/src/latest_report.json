  "problems": [
    "2.4GHz channel congestion due to multiple networks using channel 11.",
    "Interference from nearby 5GHz networks, particularly on channels 36 and 157.",
    "Random dropouts could be due to the router positioning near a window, which may lead to signal loss."
  ],
  "fixes": [
    "Change the 2.4GHz channel to either 1 or 6 to avoid congestion on channel 11.",
    "Switch the 5GHz channel to 149 or 161 for less interference.",
    "Consider relocating the router to a more central location to improve coverage.",
    "Enable Smart Connect or Band Steering to optimize device connections.",
    "Ensure firmware is up-to-date for optimal performance."
