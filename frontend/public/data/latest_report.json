    "explanation": "The Wi-Fi network is performing reasonably well, but there are notable disturbances due to channel congestion.",
    "trend": {
      "download_delta_mbps": -10.78,
      "upload_delta_mbps": 2.99,
      "ping_delta_ms": -3.1,
      "networks_delta": -1
    },
    "trend_summary": "Since last scan: download worsened, upload improved, ping improved, networks decreased."
  },
  "diagnosis": "The primary issue appears to be network congestion on the 2.4GHz band, which may lead to the random dropouts experienced. Additionally, there are several neighboring networks affecting performance.",
  "performance": {
    "download_mbps": 111.26,
    "upload_mbps": 23.24,
    "ping_ms": 25.43,
    "interpretation": "The current speeds are generally above the ISP plan, indicating good throughput. However, ping times are moderate, suggesting occasional delays."
  },
  "problems": [
    "High congestion on the 2.4GHz band with multiple overlapping SSIDs.",
    "Poor RSSI on some connected devices, leading to unreliable connections.",
    "Interference from neighboring networks affecting overall performance."
  ],
  "fixes": [
    "Change the 2.4GHz channel to either 1 or 6 to minimize interference. Channel 1 has fewer neighboring networks.",
    "Switch the 5GHz channel to 149 or 161, as channels 36 are congested with multiple networks.",
    "Position the router in a more central location within the home to improve coverage and reduce dropouts."
